### Organizazation of the analysis
The original study aimed to explore the potential of edaravone (mitochondiral-targeted drug) to slow down progression of the neurodegenerative disease [Spinocerebellar Ataxia 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinocerebellar_ataxia_type_1) (SCA1) in mice genetically engeneered (*knock-in*) to show hallmarks of the disease (***SCA1 mice***)

Thus, the main objetive of all analyses is comaprison of edaravone-treated vs. control (on saline) mice with SCA1 disease in numerous indicators of the diseases severity (although data the effects of presence of the disease and the effect of edaravone on healthy mice were also analysed for most outcomes). In sum, we had following 3 or 4 groups of mice

- helathy mice treated with saline (***WT_0***)
- healthy mice treated with edaravone (***WT_E***, *! only for behavioural and mitochondrial-function-related outcomes*)
- SCA1 mice treated with saline (***SCA1_0***)
- SCA1 mice treted with edaravone (***SCA1_E***)
